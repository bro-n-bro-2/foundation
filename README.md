# Bro-n-bro foundation

v1.0.0 (actual till 2022/01/01 00.00.00 UTC)

## The Idea

By this agreement, we define bro-n-bro foundation, as a sovereign self-funded community of scientists, developers, engineers and craftsmen who support its mission.

## The Mission

The mission is a support and develops a decentralized world

## Values

We believe that we are united by the values we share, thus helping us to achieve our goals:

- Security. We work with digital signatures only
- Anonymity. If someone chooses to stay anonymous or private - it is their right to do so
- Open-source. Everything we run in production must be open-source either software or hardware.
- Transparency. Transactional transparency is fundamental to community building
- Informational freedom. No local laws can prohibit the flow of any information
- Economic freedom. Nobody has the right to prevent or block transactions
- Free will. We reject corporate slavery bullshit, such as conflict of interest or NDA
- Capital, not salary. Helping to switch our team from selling time to selling knowledge
- Engineering is marketing. We would rather spend our resources on the engineering of marketing, than on marketing itself.
- Physical liberty. Limitations for physical liberty can be economic, but not authoritative
- Automation. Everything that can be automated, must be automated
- Intelligence. An entity can be treated as intelligent if they can control their private keys and can sign transactions
- Decentralization. Everything that has a single point of failure may not have it
- Build for centuries. We believe our grandchildren could use what we built

## Adding bros

Bro-n-bro expanding if and only if bro-n-bro members approve the adding of a new bro. The conditions of adding will be defined by bro-n-bro in each case separately.

## Removing bros

If one bro is leaving, they receive a one-time drop, which is calculated by using the following formula:
`total valuation of assets under control / number of bros * 0.5`

The other 50% will be left in the foundation.
The drop must be executed in 30 calendar days after the initiation of a proposal.

As an exceptional case, it is possible to remove a bro by a governance proposal. Not recommended to use. No bro way.

## Liquidation procedure

Foundation can liquidate itself. If this event happens the following will occur:

- The software goes to a public domain
- The hardware obtains personal freedom
- Non-transferable tokens will await being transferable
- Non-fungible items will be auctioned
- 50% of transferable tokens, will be dropped to founders. 50% will be dropped to teams.

## Processing incoming drops

If a community decides to drop to bro-n-bro, they must understand the following guidelines:

- 60% is dumped back in favor of our communities and will remain under the control of bro-n-brp. bro-n-bro can choose to fully keep the dropped tokens to itself;
- 40% of the tokens will be dropped to teams

## Forks

If any team feels the independent need to create a new organization or a fork, they are free to do so. Bro-n-bro members will benefit from such behavior and are ready, in case the team is self-sustainable, to transfer repositories.
